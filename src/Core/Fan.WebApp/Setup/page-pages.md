# Introduction

Pages are created in the **Page Composer**. Pages are either **Published** or in **Draft**, they are hierarchical and maximum two levels deep. Only published pages are visible to the public, if a parent page is a draft then none of its children will be visible to the public either.

# Editor Shortcuts

The Page Composer uses a Markdown editor. When the editor is in focus, type `Shift + Alt + H` will bring up a Help Dialog that shows you its keyboard shortcuts. To add images just drag & drop them in.

# Layouts

Theme designers can create different layouts for pages to suit different scenarios. The default theme **Clarity** has 3 layouts.

# Navigations

Parent pages can be asigned to the **[Site Navigation](/admin/navigation)**, parent pages with children will also have **Page Navigation**.

A parent page with at least one child will have the ability to create a page navigation, like the one shown on the sidebar of the [[docs]]. Just make sure you have the Page Navigation [widget](/admin/widgets "widget") placed in the according sidebar area.
