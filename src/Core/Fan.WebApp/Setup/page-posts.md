# Introduction

Blog posts can be created with the **Post Composer** or **Open Live Writer**. Posts are either **Published** or in **Drafts**, they are **Categorized** and optionally **Tagged**. For more info visit the offical [docs](https://fanray.com/docs/posts "Fanray Docs").

# Editor Shortcuts

The Post Composer uses a Rich Text editor and these shortcuts will make you productive.

| Shortcuts | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| # + space | Use one or more # for headings (h1, h2 etc.) |
| > + space | Quote |
| - + space | Unordered list (ul) |
| ``  | Inline code |
| Select text, Ctrl + k | Make text link |
| Shift + enter | Soft break (br) |

# Images

To add images to your post just drag & drop them in. Only png, jpg and gif files are supported. Same with Pages.

# Slug and Post Date

Fanray uses SEO-friendly URLs for blog posts. The post slug and date are part of a post's URL. 💥 Be aware updating an already published post’s slug or date may cause issues with search engines.
